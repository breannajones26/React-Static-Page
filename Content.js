      <p>Once upon a time, there was a fast and boastful hare who liked to challenge other animals to races. One day, he challenged the slow-moving tortoise to a race, thinking it would be an easy win.</p>
      <p>The race began, and the hare quickly ran ahead, leaving the tortoise far behind. Confident he would win, the hare took a nap mid-race. Meanwhile, the tortoise kept going steadily and slowly, not stopping for anything.</p>
      <p>When the hare woke up, the tortoise was already at the finish line, having won the race. The hare learned a valuable lesson about overconfidence and underestimating others.</p>
